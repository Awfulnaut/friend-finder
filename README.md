# Friend Finder
The friend finder is an app that will match you with a similarly-minded friend. Users fill out a survey, and the app compares your scores with those of other users and will return the most closely matched individual.

The Friend Finder uses express and is deployed on heroku at [https://awfulnaut-friend-finder.herokuapp.com](https://awfulnaut-friend-finder.herokuapp.com).
